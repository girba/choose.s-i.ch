                    <p class="lead">Software plays a pivotal role in almost all aspects of our life. We put trust in software to accomplish complex and vital tasks for us, such as managing our finances, diagnosing diseases, flying airplanes or driving cars. These systems manipulate and generate an unprecedented amount of data.
                    In such a scenario, software cannot be understood without its data and data becomes valuable only thanks to the software analyzing it.</p>
                    <p class="lead">To seed discussions, we will sample the space with five high-profile
talks.

                <p>Many companies are looking into understanding and improving productivity of individual software developers as well as software teams.  In this talk, I will motivate the need for data analytics in software teams and describe how data scientists work in a large software companies helping software teams to infer actionable insights.  I will then show how data from software development can be used to learn more about the productivity of organizations, teams, and individuals and help them to become more effective in building software.</p>

                <h3>Daring to Do Projects Others Do Not Dare to Dream</h3>
                <p>Somewhere between forward engineering of compilers for new languages and reverse engineering legacy software systems, there is an interesting area of industrial research and development: reverse engineering legacy languages and building tools for their automated retiring or upgrade. This talk will go through a typical project of compiler (re)development for a legacy language, facing the usual challenges: the lack of documentation, dealing with ancient paradigms and mindsets, large scale software analysis and transformation, refactoring while preserving undefined semantics, inferring the original developers' intent by code analysis, etc. Reasonably obfuscated examples will be provided from various projects in current and recent development by the presenter and his colleagues.</p>

He has done research in that direction at Universität Koblenz-Landau in Germany (2008–2010), Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica in the Netherlands (2010–2013), as well as at University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands (2013–2016) where he also was extensively involved in teaching many graduate-level courses, supervising student projects, maintaining and expanding the network of university relations with the industry. Besides software language engineering with grammar(ware) technology, his interests and research activities tend to invade such topics as software quality assessment, source code analysis and transformation, (meta)modelling, as well as maintenance and renovation of legacy systems.

                <h3>Are we drinking too much Big Data and Machine Learning Kool-Aid?!</h3>
                <p>Is it always better to add more projects to our studies? Should we be using the fanciest Machine Learning (ML) techniques? With the ease of access to data about large projects (e.g., PROMISE and MSR Data Showcase), and the ease of access to advanced ML toolkits (e.g., R, Weka, and Scikit-learn), we are seeing more and more papers going for bigger and fancier (with reviewers quite often demanding so). In this talk, I will take a critical look at how bigger and fancier often leads to way less!<br>

                I will discuss how such a blind rush to using as much data, and as fancy ML as possible is quite often risking the validity of our empirical findings, even when combined with careful qualitative analysis of some of the studied projects.<br>

                Throughout the talk, I will provide concrete examples of such risks while proposing best practices that the software analytics community needs to follow to avoid such risks.

                <h3>Inferring procedure specifications for automated testing</h3>
                <p>Procedure specifications are useful in many software development  tasks. As one example, in automatic test case generation they can  guide testing, act as test oracles able to reveal bugs, and identify  illegal inputs. Whereas formal specifications are seldom available  in practice, it is standard practice for developers to document their  code with semi-structured comments such as Doxygen, Javadoc,  RDoc, and Sphinx. These comments express the procedure specification with a mix of predefined tags and natural language.  We present Toradocu, an approach that combines natural language parsing, pattern matching, and semantic similarity to  translate Javadoc comments into executable procedure specifications written as Java expressions. The tool achieves better accuracy than the other similar tools in the state of the art. We supplied the automatically derived specifications to Randoop, an automated test case generation tool. The specifications enabled Randoop to generate test cases that reveal more defects and produce fewer false alarms.
